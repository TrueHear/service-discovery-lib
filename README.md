# Service Discovery Library

A lightweight **Node.js** library for discovering smart IP devices (such as Genelec speakers or other PoE devices) using **mDNS (Multicast DNS)**. This library offers both callback-based and async/await (Promise-based) APIs along with an interactive CLI for device discovery on your local network.

---

## Overview

This library allows you to:

- Discover smart IP devices by querying specific mDNS services.
- Parse mDNS messages including PTR, SRV, TXT, and A records.
- Filter and track unique devices using a Map.
- Choose network interfaces by filtering based on IP version (IPv4, IPv6, or Both) and internal/external status.
- Control the search duration via a configurable timeout.
- Use either a modern async/await approach or the older callback-based API.

---

## Features

- **mDNS Service Discovery:** Find smart IP devices on your network.
- **Async/Await Support:** Use `search_mdns_servicesmv1` for a modern, promise-based API.
- **Callback-Based Discovery:** Use `search_mdns_services` for a traditional callback approach.
- **Dynamic Timeout:** Configure search duration (default: 5000ms).
- **Interface Filtering:** Filter by IP version (IPv4/IPv6/Both) and by internal vs. non-internal interfaces.
- **Unique Device Tracking:** Duplicates are automatically filtered out.
- **Interactive CLI:** A fully interactive command-line tool for listing interfaces and performing device searches.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Graceful exit on Ctrl+C and detailed error messages.

## Installation

Install via **npm**:

```bash
npm install service-discovery-lib
```

For local development, see the [Local Testing](#local-testing) section below.

## Usage

### Async/Await API (v1)

The new `search_mdns_servicesmv1` function returns a Promise that resolves with an array of unique devices after the search timeout.

#### **Example:**

```js
const { search_mdns_servicesmv1, list_interfaces } = require('service-discovery-lib');

(async () => {
    // List available network interfaces
    const interfaces = list_interfaces();
    console.log('Available network interfaces:');
    console.log(interfaces);
    
    // Define options for discovery
    const options = {
        timeout: 5000,                    // Search duration in milliseconds
        service_query: '_smart_ip._tcp',  // mDNS service query
        interface: interfaces[0].address, // Use the first available interface
        mdns_address: '224.0.0.251',        // mDNS multicast address
        mdns_port: 5353                   // mDNS port
    };

    try {
        console.log('Starting smart IP device discovery...');
        const devices = await search_mdns_servicesmv1(options);
        console.log('Discovery complete. Unique devices found:');
        console.log(devices);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error during mDNS search:', error);
    }
})();
```

#### **Sample Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Genelec-1",
    "addresses": ["192.168.1.105"],
    "port": 5353,
    "properties": { "location": "Office", "model": "1234" }
  },
  {
    "name": "Genelec-2",
    "addresses": ["192.168.1.106"],
    "port": 5353,
    "properties": { "location": "Studio", "model": "5678" }
  }
]
```

---

### Callback-Based API (v0)

If you prefer a callback-based approach, use `search_mdns_services`. It relies on callbacks for processing each discovered service and for signaling when the search is complete.

#### **Example:**

```js
const { search_mdns_services } = require('service-discovery-lib');

const options = {
    timeout: 5000,
    service_query: '_smart_ip._tcp',
    interface: 'YOUR_LOCAL_INTERFACE_IP',
    mdns_address: '224.0.0.251',
    mdns_port: 5353,
    on_service_found: (service) => {
        console.log('Smart IP device found:', service);
    },
    on_search_complete: (devices) => {
        console.log('Discovery finished. Unique devices found:');
        console.log(devices);
    }
};

search_mdns_services(options);
```

#### **Sample Response:**

As devices are discovered, you might see:

```
Smart IP device found: { name: 'Genelec-1', port: 5353, addresses: [ '192.168.1.105' ], properties: { location: 'Office' } }
Smart IP device found: { name: 'Genelec-2', port: 5353, addresses: [ '192.168.1.106' ], properties: { location: 'Studio' } }
Discovery finished. Unique devices found: [ ... ]
```

---

### Listing Network Interfaces

The `list_interfaces` function returns an array of network interface objects containing details such as name, address, family, MAC, and whether the interface is internal.

#### **Example:**

```js
const { list_interfaces } = require('service-discovery-lib');

const interfaces = list_interfaces();
console.log('Network interfaces:', interfaces);
```

#### **Sample Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "name": "eth0",
    "address": "192.168.1.100",
    "family": "IPv4",
    "mac": "00:1a:2b:3c:4d:5e",
    "internal": false
  },
  {
    "name": "lo",
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "family": "IPv4",
    "mac": "00:00:00:00:00:00",
    "internal": true
  }
]
```

---

## CLI Usage

An interactive CLI tool is provided in the `bin` directory as `smart-ip-cli.js`. This CLI allows you to:

- **List Network Interfaces:** View details (name, address, family, MAC, and internal flag) of all available interfaces.
- **Search for Devices:** Select the IP version (IPv4, IPv6, or Both), filter interfaces by internal status, and customize parameters like mDNS address, port, service query, and timeout.
- **Graceful Exit:** Exit the tool cleanly using Ctrl+C or through menu options.

#### **To run the CLI:**

1. Ensure the CLI file is executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x bin/smart-ip-cli.js
   ```

2. Run it directly:

   ```bash
   ./bin/smart-ip-cli.js
   ```

   Or, if configured in your `package.json` under the `"bin"` field, run:

   ```bash
   smart-ip
   ```

#### CLI Interface

For detailed instructions on how to install and use the CLI tool globally, please see the [Smart IP CLI Interface Documentation](./CLI-Readme.md).
