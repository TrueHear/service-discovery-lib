# Smart IP CLI Interface

The **Smart IP CLI Interface** allows you to discover smart IP devices (e.g., Genelec speakers or similar PoE devices) on your local network via mDNS in an interactive, user-friendly way.

## Global Installation

To install the CLI tool globally, run:

```bash
npm install -g service-discovery-lib
```

This command installs the package globally and creates a symlink for the CLI command defined in your package‚Äôs `bin` field (e.g., `smart-ip`).

## Using the CLI

Once installed globally, you can launch the CLI by running:

```bash
smart-ip
```

### What to Expect

- **Main Menu:**  
  When you run `smart-ip`, you‚Äôll see a main menu offering options to:
  - **List Network Interfaces:** View available interfaces with details (name, IP address, family, etc.).
  - **Search for smart_ip Devices:** Start a guided discovery process with customizable options.
  - **Exit:** Close the CLI tool gracefully.

- **Interactive Prompts:**  
  The CLI will prompt you to select:
  - The IP version to include (IPv4, IPv6, or Both).
  - Whether to filter by all, internal, or non-internal interfaces.
  - The specific network interface you‚Äôd like to use.
  - Custom values such as service query (default: `_smart_ip._tcp`), search timeout (in ms), mDNS address (default: `224.0.0.251`), and mDNS port (default: `5353`).

- **Search Results:**  
  After configuring your options, the tool performs an mDNS search and displays discovered devices in a formatted list with details like:
  - Device name
  - IP addresses
  - Port
  - Additional properties

- **Graceful Exit:**  
  You can exit the CLI at any time by choosing the ‚ÄúExit‚Äù option or by pressing **Ctrl+C**, which terminates the process cleanly.

## Example Session

1. **Launch the CLI:**

   ```bash
   smart-ip
   ```

2. **Select an Option:**  
   You might see a prompt like:

   ```
   ? What would you like to do? 
     ‚Ä∫ üì° List Network Interfaces 
       üîç Search for smart_ip Devices 
       ‚ùå Exit
   ```

3. **Device Discovery:**  
   If you select **Search for smart_ip Devices**, you‚Äôll be guided through prompts such as:

   ```
   ? Select IP version to include: (Use arrow keys)
     ‚Ä∫ IPv4
       IPv6
       Both

   ? Select interface filtering mode:
     ‚Ä∫ All interfaces
       Non-internal interfaces
       Internal interfaces

   ? Select the network interface to use:
     ‚Ä∫ eth0 (192.168.1.100) [IPv4]
       lo (127.0.0.1) [IPv4]
   ```

4. **Enter Custom Options:**  
   Then enter the service query, timeout, mDNS address, and port. Defaults are provided, so you can simply press **Enter** if you‚Äôre okay with the defaults.

5. **View Results:**  
   After a short search period, the CLI displays the discovered devices with their details.

## Troubleshooting

- **Ctrl+C Handling:**  
  If you need to cancel the process at any point, press **Ctrl+C**. The CLI is designed to exit gracefully without error messages.

- **Updating:**  
  If you make changes to your local package and wish to test updates, use `npm link` in development. Then re-install globally if needed.

## Conclusion

The **Smart IP CLI Interface** is a quick and interactive way to discover mDNS-enabled devices on your network. It simplifies the process with guided prompts and clear output‚Äîmaking device discovery easy and efficient.
